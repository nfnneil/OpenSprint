# OpenSprint
OpenSpring is an open source, free to use version of Spritz.  It attempts to allow those with reading disabilities to increase their reading speeds by combining OpenDyslexic monospace font set with Spritz's reading technology.

Our goal is to create a free reading technology that
helps the disabled increase reading speeds.  Spitz
has proven to increase reading speeds, even for
the disabled and OpenDyslexic is a freeware font that
makes people with visual reading disabilities (i.e.
dyslexics) read at an increased rate.  I wrote this in
HTML/JS/CSS so the program can run in browser; so, basically
anywhere.

Feel free to use OpenSprint with or without credit.

Index.html features an example as to how to use the library.
Simply include the main.js file and modify the div.content
to be whatever you need and you're good to go!
