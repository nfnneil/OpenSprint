I wrote this for fun, I hope you find it useful.

Index.html has an example of what to copy and paste.  Simply include all the references: jquery, main.js, and main.css along with the HTML code inside the file and you're good to go!

Put whatever you want it to read inside the "content" class and it will read it allowed. It is compatible with any language, including japanese and etc.

If you have any suggestions, please contact me.
